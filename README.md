# MkvTagRemover
A program that I've written to quickly delete badly written description tags (described by this sequence of bytes {18,84,-61,103}) in .mkv files.

TODO:
- Change program's logic from "delete all description tags" to select what to delete
- Better analyze the edge cases - leaving unused code for future reference
